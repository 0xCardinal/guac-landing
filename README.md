# guac.sh

This repository is the home of guac.sh.

## Building the site

You must have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed.

To build the site, run `hugo server -D`.
This will run a local webserver (defaults to port 1313) where you can verify your changes.

## Contributing

The repository requires a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (use the `-s` flag on `git commit`).

We do not have a style guide yet.
Perhaps someday.

## Layout

* config.yml — Site configuration and main page content
* content/blogs.md — Blog posts
* content/* — Other pages
