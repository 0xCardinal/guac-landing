<h2><a href="https://www.kusari.dev/blog/terror-of-curl/">Terror of cURL - Preparation is half the battle
</a></h2>

#### Kusari

##### October 16, 2023

Last week, on October 11th, we finally found out more information on the high-severity CVE that affected numerous versions of cURL. Everyone was waiting in dreaded anticipation to determine if they were affected or not!

GUAC allows you to be proactive in responding to threats without waiting for the CVEs to be released, reducing the MTTR significantly! In our latest combined blog with Brandon Lum and Mihai Maruseac, we discuss this in greater detail and provide insight.

</a></h2>

#### Kusari

##### June 27, 2023

As we work to meet the goals of persistence in GUAC, we are running a series of analyses and comparisons among the many different graph database options. GUAC has a few critically important requirements for the backend, including: efficient ingestion of data, performant complex queries, the schema in which the data is stored, and finally optimization of the query based on the specific language.

Today, we are announcing the launch of the v0.1 version of Graph for
Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC). Introduced at Kubecon 2022 in
October, GUAC targets a critical need in the software industry to understand the
software supply chain. In collaboration with Kusari, Purdue University, Citi,
and community members, we have incorporated feedback from our early testers to
improve GUAC and make it more useful for security professionals. This improved
version is now available as an API for you to start developing on top of, and
integrating into, your systems.

<h2><a href="https://www.kusari.dev/blog/announcement_guac/">A high fidelity view of software supply chain
</a></h2>

#### Kusari

##### October 20, 2022

Understanding and maintaining your software supply chain can be a task that
needs 24/7 vigilance. The recent report from Sonatype: State of the Software
Supply Chain has shown that supply chain attacks are on the rise (742% average
annual increase in the past 3 years). Along with the fact that 6 out of the 7
project vulnerabilities come from transitive dependencies, the industry is in
desperate need of having a clear, holistic understanding of the software supply
chain.

##### October 20, 2022

Supply chain security is at the fore of the industry’s collective consciousness.
We’ve recently seen a significant rise in software supply chain attacks, a Log4j
vulnerability of catastrophic severity and breadth, and even an Executive Order
on Cybersecurity.
