### What is a GUAC?

Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) aggregates software security
metadata into a high fidelity graph databaseâ€”normalizing entity identities and
mapping standard relationships between them. Querying this graph can drive
higher-level organizational outcomes such as audit, policy, risk management, and
even developer assistance.

### What SPDX versions are supported?

GUAC supports version 2.x of the [SPDX Specification](https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/).
